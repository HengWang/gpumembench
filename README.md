# gpumembench benchmark suite

In this repository a GPU benchmark tool will be hosted regarding the evaluation of memory bandwidth features of on-chip GPU memories. This tool has been used for the following work:

*Konstantinidis, E.; Cotronis, Y., "A quantitative performance evaluation of fast on-chip memories of GPUs,"* 
*24th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP), Heraklion, Crete, Greece, pp. 448-455, 2016*

All accompanied files are due to be published by the time the PDP'16 conference takes place (17th-19th of February 2016).
