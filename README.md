# gpumembench benchmark suite

In this repository a GPU benchmark tool will be hosted regarding the evaluation of memory bandwidth features of on-chip GPU memories. This tool has been used for the following work:

*Konstantinidis, E.; Cotronis, Y., "A quantitative performance evaluation of fast on-chip memories of GPUs,"*
*Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP), 2016 24th Euromicro International Conference on, 17-19 February 2016 (Accepted)*

All accompanied files are due to be published by the time the PDP'16 conference takes place.
